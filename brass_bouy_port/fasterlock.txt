1: 26 (21+5)
2. 18 OR 38 (i suspect 38)
	guess 1: 9
	guess 2: 8

	26/4 = 6 r 2

counter clockwise (full cirlce, then stop)
clockwise and unlock on first hit

(note--the interface will remain "green" as long as you're right. once it's red, you've lost.)

1. find the sticky number
"reset the lock"
put tension until it turns
keep turnin until the dial turns and stops consistent


2. guess numbers
between 0-11
heavy tension

must be a full number not half number

3. do the math
a. find first digit
	sticky + 5 
b. find third digit
	divide A by 4
	what's the remainer? - write down remainder
	
	guess numbers are the x and y +10
	0 10 20 30
        3 13 23 33

	divide each by 4 and find which ones have the SAME remainder
	those are two possibilities for third digit

	move to guess, put heavy tension, move
	one will be loose - loose is last digit

	
c. find the second digit
	remember remainder:
	first row: remainder + 2 add 8 4 times. 39 > 0
	second row: remainder + 2 + 4

	2 10 18 26 34
        6 14 22 30 38

	can't be within 2 numbers

4. test
